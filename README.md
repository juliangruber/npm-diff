## Installation

Either preinstall using one of the methods described below, or use `npx`
to install/run `npm-diff` on demand:

```bash
npx npm-diff
```

### Globally installed as npm module

```bash
npm install npm-diff -g
```

### Manual install

Clone this repository and run:

```bash
$ make install
```

## Usage

```bash
$ npm-diff
Usage: npm-diff <module> <versionA> <versionB>
```

  __npm-diff(1)__ outputs regular __diff(1)__ content so it plays nice with other tooling.

## Tips

  Page big diffs:

```bash
$ npm-diff intersect 0.0.0 0.1.0 | less
``` 

  Pipe to [colordiff](http://www.colordiff.org) for colored git like diffs:

```bash
$ npm-diff intersect 0.0.0 0.1.0 | colordiff | less -R
```
